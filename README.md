# Track Converter

Handles the following conversions. These are especially helpful
when dealing with track and field, cross country, or other
running events.

### Parse strings into Time objects

Enter a time string. Parse it into a Time object. 
Export as milliseconds or as a time string.

We export to milliseconds because it's much easier to represent
time as an integer than as a decimal (e.g. 22580 milliseconds or 22.58)

### Parse strings

Enter a distance string. Parse it into an EnglishMark or MetricMark object. 
Export as micrometers or as a mark string.
